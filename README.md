Autonomous Agent System This project implements a basic autonomous agent framework with reactive and proactive behavior capabilities. The agents can handle incoming messages, generate behaviors, and interact with each other in a simulated environment.


Overview The system consists of two main components:

AutonomousAgent Class: A base class that provides the core functionalities for handling messages, registering handlers, and executing behaviors.

ConcreteAgent Class: A subclass of AutonomousAgent that implements specific behaviors and message handling logic. This agent generates random messages and handles those containing the word "hello."

Features Message Handling: Agents can receive messages and process them based on registered handlers. Behavior Execution: Agents can perform proactive behaviors at defined intervals. Duplicate Message Detection: Ensures that duplicate messages are not processed multiple times. Concurrent Execution: Agents run their message-handling and behavior-execution loops concurrently using threads. Graceful Shutdown: Agents can be stopped cleanly, halting all operations. How It Works Agent Initialization: Each agent is created with a unique name and can register handlers and behaviors. Message Handling: Messages are consumed from the inbox and processed by the corresponding handler if registered. Behavior Execution: Behaviors are executed in a loop, generating messages or performing other actions. Communication: Agents communicate by emitting messages into each otherâ€™s inboxes, allowing for dynamic interaction.

Example:# Create two agent instances agent1 = ConcreteAgent("Agent1") agent2 = ConcreteAgent("Agent2")

Link inbox and outbox between agents for bidirectional communication
agent1.outbox = agent2.inbox agent2.outbox = agent1.inbox

Start agent threads
threading.Thread(target=agent1.consume_messages, daemon=True).start() threading.Thread(target=agent1.run_behaviors, daemon=True).start() threading.Thread(target=agent2.consume_messages, daemon=True).start() threading.Thread(target=agent2.run_behaviors, daemon=True).start()

Allow agents to run for a set time before stopping
time.sleep(10)

Stop agents gracefully
agent1.stop() agent2.stop()

Design Choices and Feedback Design Choices: Concurrency: Threading was used to allow simultaneous execution of message handling and behavior execution. This decision ensures that the agent remains responsive and can perform tasks independently.

Duplicate Message Detection: A simple list check was implemented in the emit_message function to avoid processing the same message multiple times. This approach works efficiently in this context but might need optimization for larger-scale scenarios.

Behavior and Message Registration: Behaviors and handlers are registered dynamically, allowing the agent to be easily extended with new functionalities.

Error Logging: Instead of raising exceptions, the design favors logging messages when errors or unexpected scenarios occur, such as missing handlers or empty messages. This approach keeps the agent robust and avoids crashing during execution.

Feedback on Design: Scalability: The current implementation works well for small-scale, controlled environments. For larger applications, consider using queues instead of lists for inboxes and outboxes to manage concurrency more effectively.

Message Prioritization: Future versions could benefit from prioritizing messages to handle urgent tasks more efficiently, which would require adjustments to the message handling loop.

Graceful Exit: A more sophisticated shutdown mechanism might be needed for agents with complex or long-running behaviors.

Error Handling: While logging errors provides insight, implementing recovery strategies or fallbacks could make the agent more resilient, especially in unpredictable environments.
